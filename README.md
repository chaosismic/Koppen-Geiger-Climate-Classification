# Koppen-Geiger-Climate-Classification

The objective is to determine the Köppen climate classification for multiple reference points. In this code, we use multiple precipitation and temperature rasters as input. Based on these rasters, we extract the values for the reference points to classify their climate.


In the research by Karki et al. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1549-0), they introduced modifications to the general Köppen-Geiger classification limits to better reflect the climate of Nepal, leading to what is known as the 'Modified Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification' for Nepal. If you wish to calculate the original, unmodified climate classification, you can do so by changing the relevant values in the code.


The input datasets used in the code were generated using the 0.05-degree gridded datasets from APHRODITE.
